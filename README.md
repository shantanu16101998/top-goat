# Top Goat Repository

## How to use

1) Install github
2) Install python3
3) clone this repo
4) checkout to master branch
5) activate the env myenv (source myenv/bin/activate)
6) python3 tester.py 

## Configs

Change the config.py for various options

FILE_NAME           = "which file to consider"
LANGUAGE_TO_ANSWER  = "what should be the options"
QUESTION_TYPE       = "MCQ" or "WORD"
NUMBER_OF_OPTIONS   = 5 
NUMBER_OF_QUESTIONS = 10

## Speciality

1) It won't let you go unless you make every choice right (It will self repeat)
2) uses similarity based aglo to confuse you with options

## Recommended approach

1) try to do 3 sets of 10 questions on weekdays and 10 sets of 10 questions on weekends
2) if you want to have more challenge change the QUESTION_TYPE to WORD ;) 


Anyone who has expertise kindly say how can I make it a standalone app this would solve all the hassles of github
